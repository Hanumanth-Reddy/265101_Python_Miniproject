 ## Files:

  - `hangman.py` - complete project code.
  - `words.txt`  - file that contains words to play game, and some operations for 
   admin like read and write data to file.

 ## Working

  - Initially menu() was called and displays operations.
  
  - `Admin`- admin can perform read and write to file.
  
  - `play` - Every time player start to play game a new words will be picked from file dynamically using random function
  and spaces are provided according to the length of word. player has 8 chances to guess a words to win else lost.
  once the play was ended, it will prompt the player whether they want to play again or end.
   
 ## Modules imported

  - `random` - choice() is used to pick random word.
  
  - `time`   - sleep() to produce time delay between functions.
